Enable the testsigning mode in the vista boot loader:

bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON


These instructions are for the first time you sign a driver:

1) Create the certificate:

makecert.exe -$ individual  -r -pe -ss "WRFan Certificate Store" -n  CN="WRFan Treibersignierung" "WRFan Treibersignierung.cer"

2) Install the certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store:

certmgr.exe /add "WRFan Treibersignierung.cer" /s /r localMachine root

or do it manually through the Certificate snap-in:

%windir%\System32\certmgr.msc


3) Sign the driver with the certificate:

signtool.exe sign /v /s "WRFan Certificate Store" /n "WRFan Treibersignierung" BT848.sys

4) Verify the signed driver validity:

signtool.exe verify /pa /v BT848.sys

5) Overwrite the original driver with the signed one and reboot your system. Changes to the vista boot loader require a reboot, if you already are in testsigning mode, you might open the device manager and re-activate the device that relies on the signed driver, then a reboot is not necessary

For signing further drivers, repeat steps 3 + 4 + 5
